# iTunesController
Control iTunes from cmd line!

Kind of a pointless project but pretty cool to mess around with Powershell. 
##### There's a reason why they call it POWERshell.

###Command List [so far]

####Open Itunes
`itunes start`

####Open Itunes
`itunes restart`

####Play Next Song
`itunes next`

####Pause Current Song
`itunes pause`

####Play Current Song
`itunes play`

Todo:
- Add the ability to search song by name (return a list to choose from)
- Add more detailed return text
